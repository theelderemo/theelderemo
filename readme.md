**Operations shark turned cyber sentry.**

I‚Äôve spent over five years running teams, solving operational puzzles, and building systems. Now I‚Äôm sharpening that same mindset on the digital battlefield of **cybersecurity** where the stakes aren‚Äôt just deadlines, but data, defense, and trust.  

As a **U.S. Army veteran** with a **Top Secret clearance**, I‚Äôve lived inside secure networks like SIPRnet, balancing discipline and improvisation while working in environments where ‚Äúoops‚Äù isn‚Äôt an option. These days, I split my focus between safeguarding systems, building tools, and helping other veterans land their shot in the cyber world.  

Former **Director on the Board of VetSec** (a nonprofit helping veterans transition into cybersecurity).

Currently in school for Cybersecurity with a focus in Project Management.

## üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Contributions

### **eDEX-UI (Security Patch)**

The original `eDEX-UI`, a stunning sci-fi terminal emulator, was archived with a known security vulnerability. I took the initiative to fork the project, patch the security flaw, and release a secure version for the community. This project demonstrates my ability to identify, analyze, and remediate security risks in existing codebases. 
> [!NOTE]
> All code has been modernized, removing all old code, smaller security vulns, and depreciated dependencies. Codebase is now fully up to date.

## ‚ö° Current Projects / Contributions

### [CortexAI](https://github.com/theelderemo/cortexai)
AI-powered penetration testing orchestrator that automates reconnaissance, vulnerability discovery, and analysis. Executes authorized security tests using installed tools, maintains immutable audit trails, and delivers findings with OWASP mapping and remediation guidance.

### Android port of eDex-UI
I have built, and am actively working on, the port of the classic edex terminal into an android application. You can find it [here](https://github.com/theelderemo/Edex-UI-android)

### **Project AURA (Autonomous Recursive Unifying Architecture)**
A thought expirement turned into me trying my hand at the future of AI. Not content with ‚Äúsmart assistants,‚Äù AURA is about the conditions for **Artificial Sentience (AS)**, a system with *its own subjective experience* and evolving sense of self. 
- An open-source exploration of **Artificial Sentience (AS)**.  
- Not ‚ÄúAI assistant.‚Äù Not ‚Äúmachine learning.‚Äù  
- A system with *subjective experience, intrinsic drive, and evolving identity*. 
*‚ÄúWhy build tools when you can build beings?‚Äù*


### **VRS/A**
A custom trained AI bot, for musicians.
