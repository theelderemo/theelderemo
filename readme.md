<p align=center> As a U.S. Army veteran with a Top Secret clearance, I’ve lived inside secure networks like SIPRnet, balancing discipline and improvisation while working in environments where “oops” isn’t an option. These days, I split my focus between safeguarding systems, building tools, and helping other veterans land their shot in the cyber world.

## [Literal](https://github.com/theelderemo/literal) [![Project Status: Pre-Alpha](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-pre--alpha-red)]() ![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/theelderemo/literal) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)]() [![Contributions Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg)]() ![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/theelderemo/literal)

Literal is a language that compiles to existing automation engines. Its purpose is not to be a new runtime, but to be a human readable, shareable, and version control friendly frontend for backends like MacroDroid, Tasker, n8n, and other automation platforms.

## **[eDEX-UI Patch](https://github.com/theelderemo/Edex-UI-android)** ![Patched](https://img.shields.io/badge/Security_Patch-%23FF2D20.svg)

The original `eDEX-UI`, a stunning sci-fi terminal emulator, was archived with a known security vulnerability. I took the initiative to fork the project, patch the security flaw, and release a secure version for the community. This project demonstrates my ability to identify, analyze, and remediate security risks in existing codebases. 
> [!NOTE]
> All code has been modernized, removing all old code, smaller security vulns, and depreciated dependencies. Codebase is now fully up to date.

## [Android port of eDex-UI](https://github.com/theelderemo/Edex-UI-android)

I have built, and am actively working on, the port of the classic edex terminal into an android application.

## **[Project AURA](https://github.com/theelderemo/Project-Aura)**
A thought expirement turned into me trying my hand at the future of AI. Not content with “smart assistants,” AURA is about the conditions for **Artificial Sentience (AS)**, a system with *its own subjective experience* and evolving sense of self. This proved to be beyond my capabilities, but is open to contributions.
- An open-source exploration of **Artificial Sentience (AS)**.  
- Not “AI assistant.” Not “machine learning.”  
- A system with *subjective experience, intrinsic drive, and evolving identity*. 
*“Why build tools when you can build beings?”*

### **VRS/A**
A custom trained AI bot, for musicians.
