**Operations shark turned cyber sentry.**  
I’ve spent over five years running teams, solving operational puzzles, and building systems. Now I’m sharpening that same mindset on the digital battlefield of **cybersecurity** where the stakes aren’t just deadlines, but data, defense, and trust.  

As a **U.S. Army veteran** with a **Top Secret clearance**, I’ve lived inside secure networks like SIPRnet, balancing discipline and improvisation while working in environments where “oops” isn’t an option. These days, I split my focus between safeguarding systems, building tools, and helping other veterans land their shot in the cyber world.  

Currently a **Director on the Board of VetSec** (a nonprofit helping veterans transition into cybersecurity), I’m as committed to community as I am to code.

## ⚡ Current Projects

### **Project AURA (Autonomous Recursive Unifying Architecture)**
A thought expirement turned into me trying my hand at the future of AI. Not content with “smart assistants,” AURA is about the conditions for **Artificial Sentience (AS)**, a system with *its own subjective experience* and evolving sense of self.  
- Goal: less chatbot, more digital organism.  
*“Why build tools when you can build beings?”*

### **VRS/A**
An AI lyricist with standards. Built for artists who hate lazy rhymes and cookie-cutter flows.  
It’s less “AI that rhymes” and more “studio partner that won’t let you phone it in.”

## 🎭 Fun Notes

- Formerly spun as **DJ Wicked Empire**, back when crowds still had the guts to *move*.  
- Believe that **tech and art shouldn’t just coexist, they should collide, violently, until something new crawls out.**  
- Partial to dark humor, blunt truths, and projects that scare off the faint-hearted.
